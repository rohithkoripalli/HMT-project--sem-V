These are the codes for the following problems from PRINCIPLES OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER 7/ED by Incropera 
Question 1.
A platen of thermal conductivity k = 15 W/m-K is heated by flow of a hot fluid
through channels of width L = 20 mm, with T∞,i = 200 °C and hi = 500 W/m2

-K. The upper
surface of the platen is used to heat a process fluid at T∞,o = 25 °C with a convection coefficient
of ho = 250 W/m2

-K. The lower surface of the platen is insulated. Initially, the platen is at the
process fluid temperature Ti = T∞,o = 25 °C. The hot fluid is switched on at t = 0. To heat the
process fluid uniformly, the temperature of the platen’s upper surface must be uniform to within
5 °C. Use implicit time marching to solve this as a transient conduction problem. Start with an
initial guess of W = 2L. Assume that the platen is very large in the direction perpendicular to
the page.
Plot key temperatures as a function of time

Question 2.
Explicit time marching and implicit time marching.
